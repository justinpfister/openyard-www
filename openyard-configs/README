* Welcome to Openyard.com *
*-------------------------*

Most of the files in the Openyard .git repo are designed to help run the e-commerce application as is. However, the server still needs to be built and some libraries such as Symphony, Silex, Doctrine, phpmyadmin have their own git repositories and they are located in places other than the websites root. Therefore, this documents main use is to help us set the server up so that it will optimize the main code.

BASIC DIRECTORY SECURITY:
---------------------------
Change Directory            cd /var
Change ownership            sudo chown -R www-data:webdev www
Modify ownership            sudo chmod -R ug=wrx,o= www



SERVER SETUP NOTES:
----------------------------
The server steps should generally be completed in order.

    apt-get update
    apt-get install aptitude
        aptitude -y install build-essential
    apt-get install python-software-properties

    Other Seemingly Critical updates : libxslt1-dev, libgd2-xpm-dev, libxt-dev, libperl-dev
    Things to think about : apt-get source

    Install NGIN-X
    -----------------------------------
    add-apt-repository ppa:nginx/stable         Note : ppa helps modify the apt-get dictionary so the nginx (most stable) is retrieved instead of the default.
    add-apt-repository ppa:nginx/development    Note : most up to date development version
    apt-get update                              Note : this step is always required after you modify the apt-get repository
    apt-get install nginx                       Note : install the web server!

    Install PHP
    -----------------------------------
    add-apt repository ppa:{get info}/ppa   Note : if you want the latest build, you'll need to get connect to a ppa who has completed it. Else don't worry about it.
    apt-get update
    apt-get install php???                  Note : the exact command needs to be found. but php install is really well documented

    Install MySQL
    ------------------------------------
    apt-get install mysql???                Note : Please verify

    Install Memcached
    ------------------------------------
    ?                                       Note : Please look up


NGINX Server Modifications
--------------------------
NGINX should be working at this point, however, the proper config file needs to be loaded

    get config from this .git repo. ( /server_configs/default )
    restart nginx   " sudo /etc/init.d/nginx restart "

WWW Folder Setup : Note : - it might help to just copy and past the results of 'ls -l' or something. 'ls -l' seemed sloppy but there's got to be a simular command.
---------------------------
/var/www/{site_name}/{subdir}

    Current setup:
    ---------------------
    openyard development        /var/www/openyard.com/development/
    openyard stable             /var/www/openyard.com/stable/
    phpmyadmin                  /var/www/phpmyadmin/
    testing                     /var/www/testdomain/www/

VENDORS FOLDER INFO:
Location : /var/www/vendors
Contents :

                IMPORTANT : run these two commands after you 'git clone' the files
                    git submodule init
                    git submodule update
